item.alchemyBag.*.1,Alchemy Bag,"Crafting an alchemy bag gives you a colored bag, of which there are 16 possible. Each color has a unique inventory it is tied to. Multiple bags of the same color will always open the same inventory. Some of the alchemical chest powers apply to these bags, and items within will do as they would within your inventory or within a chest."
item.alchemicalCoal.*.1,Alchemical Coal,Alchemical Coal is a more efficient form of furnace fuel. It is a step on the transmutation path toward making Mobius Fuel. It burns much longer than regular coal.
item.mobiusFule.*.1,Mobius Fuel,"Mobius Fuel is the longest burning type of fuel, and will burn nearly 16 times what one piece of coal can do."

tile.dmFurnace.*.1,Dark Matter Furnace,"This potent alchemy furnace has a total of 9 input and 9 output slots. When it runs out of material to smelt in the main stack, it will pull another stack into the input. When the output main stack is full, it will push it to an empty one or attempt to combine it with one of the other stacks. It has a 33% chance to DOUBLE the smelting result of each smelt and is 20 times faster than a standard furnace. It also operates slightly faster than a regular furnace. If there is an alchemical chest next to the furnace, it will place full stacks of smelted items into the chest, instead of the output slots."
tile.eCollector.*.1,Energy Collector,"The Energy Collector converts redstone, coal, glowstone dust, gunpowder, glowstone blocks and alchemical coal all the way to Mobius fuel, cycling products into the intake automatically using the power of the sun (or any light source). For example. if you give it some amount of redstone, it will convert them through each fuel intermediate until they are all Mobius Fuel, automatically pushing stacks of output to the eight leftmost input boxes. If you place a specific fuel in the far right slot however, the collector targets that fuel, directly converting whatever is input to that targeted fuel without converting to any possible intermediate fuels in the chain."
tile.eCondenser.*.1,Energy Condenser,"The slots along the bottom left are for fuel. Above that are the inputs. You may place virtually any vanilla block in the inputs (it will spit unacceptable inputs out) and condense the energy produced by the fuel burning into it, adding 3x the EMC value of the fuel to the input material. It will initially convert an item placed in it to the item in this chain with the next higher EMC value. You may also specify a target with the target slot, and this can be any non-fuel object with value. This will cause the condenser to skip all intermediate transmutations and go straight for what you target."
tile.alChest.*.1,Alchemical Chest,"A simple box, powered by alchemy, which condenses your inventory to a very confined space. Unlike normal chests, these do not ""combine"" when placed near each other. Alchemical Chests may hold nearly quadruple that of a normal chest - a whopping 104 items per ""block"" of storage space - making them compliment a workshop nicely. A number of the power items will also automatically do their effect while within this chest."
tile.novaCatalyst.*.1,Nova Catalyst,"Did you ever think TNT was too weak for your tastes? Have you found that 'normal' explosives tend to destroy most of the blocks they extract? Nova Catalysts are a special breed of explosives that do a few things for you:
1. They leave massive craters. They blister through all forms of material with relative ease, and have a very wide area of effect.
2. They won't hurt you, or anything for that matter. You can stand right next to the blast as it safely vaporizes all materials nearby to their appropriate ""collectable"" forms. This also means no items will ever be ""accidentally"" vaporized.
3. They don't drop individual items. Much like several of the alchemical items, this explosion drops everything in a neat, lag reducing bundle nearby the player, leaving you free to detonate massive quantities of the stuff in relative safety, and without the worry of losing the items in lava."
tile.dmBlock.*.1,Dark Matter Block,The dark matter block is nigh indestructible. If placed in a Energy Condenser the result is a Dark Matter.
tile.amArray.*.1,Anti-Matter Relay,"This block will burn nearly any item placed into it straight to raw EMC. Melting something in the Relay will cause it to be worth 150% of its original EMC value, unless it is a fuel-type item, in which case it will be worth 200%. If placed near other Blocks, such as the Energy Collector, it will speed up their own processes, at the cost of the stored EMC within the Relay. The relay only affects blocks placed horizontally to it, in the shape of a +, where the relay would be the very center, and the affected blocks would be the extending lines. If a Klein Star (any level) is placed in the output slot, the EMC will charge the Star."
tile.pedestal.*.1,Pedestal,"A Very Powerful block. The pedestal, when right-clicked or given redstone power, will activate an effect of various alchemy power items. The GUI can be opened by shift-clicking on the pedestal.  Its area of affect is 9 blocks. The effect it activates depends on what power item you place inside of its inventory."
tile.iTorch.*.1,Interdiction Torch,"The interdiction torch has a max light output, and pushes mobs 3 blocks away from itself. When powered via redstone-pulses, however, the push force is increased to 10 blocks. "
