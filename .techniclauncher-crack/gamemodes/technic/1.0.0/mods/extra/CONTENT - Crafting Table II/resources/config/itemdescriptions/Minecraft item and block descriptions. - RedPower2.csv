,,Redstone Logic
item.irWafer.*.1,Stone Wafer,A stone wafer is a support substrate for building logic circuits.
item.irWire.*.1,Stone Wire,"A stone wire is redstone baked into a stone wafer, providing a conductive path between points in the same circuit."
item.irCathode.*.1,Stone Cathode,"A stone cathode acts as an inverter, beaming red rays to nearby anodes on the same substrate."
item.irAnode.*.1,Stone Anode,"A stone anode acts as a receiver for red rays from nearby cathodes, becoming energized when powered by a cathode.
"
item.irPointer.*.1,Pointer,"A small motor allows a pointer to spin, providing the core for many more complex timing functions."
item.screwdriver.*.1,Screwdriver,"Make yourself a screwdriver to rotate your logic tiles easily! Also, in a pinch, it does as much damage as a stone sword, although it's terrible for the life of the tool, so stab that zombie in the eye!"
tile.irTimer.*.1,Redstone Timer,"Sends out a pulse at a user-specified time interval. Powering it stops the clock. Two sides are both input and output, one side is output only, and one side is input only.
"
tile.irseq.*.1,Redstone Sequencer,"Alternates between each of four sides in sequence at a user-specified speed. Since it is synchronized to world time, it also makes a handy clock - simply set it to 300 seconds.
"
tile.irpulse.*.1,Pulse Former,"Emits a short pulse when the input turns on. The pulse is sent instantaneously, which also makes it useful as a fast repeater, and because the pulse is so short, placing two back to back allows pulses to be sent in both directions.
"
tile.irlatch.*.1,RS Latch,"RS NOR latch. Turning on an input changes state. Turning on both inputs burns it out.
"
tile.irtoggle.*.1,Toggle Latch,"Changes state when the input turns on. Can also be clicked to change state manually.
"
tile.irnor.*.1,NOR Gate,"The output is on when all inputs are off. Can be clicked to disable some inputs.
"
tile.irnand.*.1,NAND Gate,"The output is off when all inputs are on. Can be clicked to disable some inputs.
"
tile.irand.*.1,AND Gate,"The output is on when all inputs are on. Can be clicked to disable some inputs.
"
tile.iror.*.1,OR Gate,The output is on when any of the inputs is on. Can be clicked to disable some inputs.
tile.irxor.*.1,XOR Gate,The output is on only when one of the inputs is on.
tile.irxnor.*.1,XNOR Gate,The output is on when the two inputs are both either on or off.
tile.irnot.*.1,NOT Gate,"All three outputs are on when the input is off.
"
tile.irbuf.*.1,Buffer Gate,All three outputs are on when the input is on.
tile.irmux.*.1,Multiplexer,"The center input selects which side input controls the output.
"
tile.rpainv.1.1,Invert Cell,"The invert cell acts as two crossing wires with an invert function. When the lower wire is unpowered, the upper wire gets powered. When the lower wire is powered, the upper wire is returned to its natural state."
tile.rpainv.2.1,Non-invert cell,"The non-invert cell acts as two crossing wires with a buffer function. When the lower wire is powered, the upper wire gets powered. When the lower wire is unpowered, the upper wire is returned to its natural state."
tile.rpanc.0.1,Null cell,"The null cell performs no logic function, simply acting as a crossover for two red alloy wires."
tile.irCounter.*.1,Counter,"Counts up by Increment for each pulse on one input, and down by Decrement for each pulse on the other. Clicking opens a GUI to allow the maximum count, increment, and decrement to be set. Each output is on when the pointer reaches the end of range in that direction."
tile.irRepeater.*.1,RedPower Repeater,"An upgraded form of repeater that takes full advantage of RedPower, like the ability to place it on the wall. In addition, it supports 9 different time constants: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 torches."
tile.rpwire.*.1,Red Alloy Wire,"These bare wires are similar to redstone, just better. They will connect to all blocks that accept or emit a redstone signal, connect to themselves and will transmit the signal to the block they are sitting upon. They will also connect to any color of insulated wire. These wires can be run on the wall and ceiling as well as the floor and will transmit a signal for 255 blocks. These will not connect to Bundled Cables."
tile.rpcable.*.1,Bundled Cable,Bundled Cables allow for the tightest wiring in this mod. A Redstone signal supplied to the cable from Insulated Wires will only transfer to other wires of the same colour attached to the cable. Every Bundled Cable supports transmission of all 16 colors of Insulated Wire in just one block. Bundled Cables can only be connected to other bundled cables (and their colored and jacketed variations and insulated wires). Every color of wire will give the same basic uncolored Bundled Cable.
tile.rpinsulated.*.1,Insulated Wire,"Like their uninsulated counterparts, Insulated Wires can be placed almost anywhere and transmit a signal over a long distance. But these will only connect to blocks that accept or emit redstone signals, themselves and uninsulated wire. They will not give the signal to the blocks they sit upon. They will especially not connect to Insulated Wires of a different color. This allows multiple wires to run right next to each other without interference. They are also needed to connect to Bundled Cables."
tile.rpcable.*.1,Colored Bundled Cable,"Colored Bundled Cables allow for the same tight wiring as uncolored ones but will have an extra ribbon around the bundle. Colored Bundled Cables can only be connected to other bundled cables of the same color, uncolored Cable Bundles and insulated wires."
tile.rparmwire.*.1,Jacketed Wire,"Jacketed wires are self-supporting and do not require a surface to sit upon. They can be made from any material that can be cut into covers. It can be connected (""stitched"") to regular wires on a surface by placing a piece of Red Alloy Wire on the surface you want it to connect to."
tile.rparmcable.*.1,Jacketed Cable,"Jacketed cables are the self-supporting version of bundled cables. They do not require a surface to sit upon. They can be made from any material that can be cut into covers and an uncolored bundled cable in the center. It cannot be crafted from colored cables. It will also only connect (""stitched"") to a surface with an uncolored cable."
,,Machines
tile.rpafurnace.*.1,Alloy Furnace,"This Furnace is required to create alloys used in RedPower Technology. Most prominent is the Red Alloy Ingot, but other new ingots require this device, too.
It can also be used to reclaim metals from some items that are no longer needed."
tile.rpbreaker.*.1,Block Breaker,"Upon receiving an electrical pulse, this machine will try to break the block in front of it. It cannot break bedrock, but it will break obsidian, for example. It will then try to eject everything harvested in the process from it's buffer through the hole in the back. If the harvested items cannot be ejected, the machine will cease to operate even on subsequent pulses, until the buffer can be cleared."
tile.rpdeploy.*.1,Deployer,"The Deployer has an inventory of 9 slots. Upon receiving an energy pulse, it will try to deploy a suitable item from it's inventory into the direction it is facing. Deploying is the same as right-clicking an item from your hotbar as a player. So it can be used to place blocks, set fire using flint and steel, put minecarts on tracks and even use buckets to collect fluids."
tile.rptranspose.*.1,Transposer,"Items falling into the front of the transposer (or pushed in by a water current or tube will be put into it's buffer. If possible this buffer will be drained through the hole in the back. Supplying an energy pulse to this block will cause it to vacuum in items from an area three blocks wide and two blocks long from it's front into it's buffer. When there's an inventory (like a chest infront of it, it will retrieve one item from that chest.
It can also be connected (inlined to tubes, for which it will be a valid target, as long it can empty it's buffer. If an inline Transposer is powered, it stops items from crossing."
tile.rpfilter.*.1,Filter,"Filters operate similar to Transposers, except that they have nine slot into which items can be placed.
When there are no items in the filtering slot, with a Redstone pulse a Filter will suck a whole stack of any item out of an inventory (chest, etc. or the ground. When there is an item in the slot, only this item will be retrieved. You can put more than one item of the same kind in the slot and it will determine the amount retrieved each pulse. This way you can retrieve up to a full stack per pulse.
Putting items in the slot will also make it a valid target only for these kind of items when connected to a tube."
tile.rptube.*.1,Pneumatic Tube,"Tubes are used to transport items. They have automatic internal routing, sending items to the closest valid destination. They have a distribution function built in, so when multiple valid destinations of the same length exist, it'll alternate between them. Valid destinations are usually inventories like chests, deployers or furnaces. If an inventory fills up and cannot accept any more items, it will cease to be a valid target. Items will be sent to the next valid destination if one exists. If no valid destinations exist, the tube will no longer accept new items.
Items are are usually supplied to tubes through the rear holes in block breakers, transposers or filters."
tile.rpitemdet.*.1,Item Detector,"This block can be placed between two pieces of tube. It can detect items passing through and emit redstone pulse signals for them, depending on configuration. The detector has 3 modes. The first mode will emit a pulse for every item. That means if you send a full stack, it will send 64 pulses. The second mode will emit a single pulse for every stack passing through. And the third mode of the item detector is ""stuffed mode"" - it will turn on when it is jammed."
tile.rpsorter.*.1,Sorting Machine,The Sorting Machine enables you to set up item delivery with military precision. Like the filter it can be used inline (meaning between tubes) or connected to an inventory (usually a chest or a buffer). It will tag items with a color if you select a color using the buttons below the columns.
tile.irbuf.*.1,Buffer,"The buffer is very similar to a chest with 5 compartments. When providing items to the buffer via tubes, pipes or similar devices, each of the 5 input sides will fill a different compartment. The output side has access to all compartments. This is very useful in combination with a sorting machine.
A common application for this block is in situations, where different inputs provide their materials at different rates. A regular chest could easily be filled up by a single item, leaving no space for other resources."
tile.rpbfurnace.*.1,Bluelectric Furnace,"Operates quite like the regular furnace in smelting and cooking items, but is twice as fast in operation. It will only work on blutricity, so you'll have to supply power through a power source. Power sources can be placed directly adjacent to it or connected by Blue Alloy Wire to transfer power."
,,Tools
item.screwdriver.*.1,Screwdriver,"Right-clicking a machine block with the screwdriver will rotate the block without the need to replace it. The block cycles through all 6 possible orientations, beginning at the start on further clicks. This will work on RedPower2 logic gates and machines as well as vanilla pistons, repeaters and dispensers."
