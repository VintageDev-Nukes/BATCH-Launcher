MAtmos is a sound atmosphere generator. When you play on any server or in singleplayer, it looks at your surroundings and generates natural noises as a soundscape, such as birds in the forest or rumbling near a lava lake or wind gusts on a hilltop, which fills out the perpetual silence of Minecraft.<br>
<br>
This is performed thanks to a knowledge base that contain rules about when and how the sounds should play. MAtmos scans your environment to approximate and describe your location.<br>
<br>
This knowledge base can be expanded with the use of expansions that can be created and written by third-parties for more various experience.
